        <section class="history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The name Sudan refers to the region south of the great African desert extending from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean in the east. However, it is now used to refer to the area south of Egypt, specifically the middle part of the Nile Basin.</p>
            <p>The Republic of Sudan is an Arab-African country that represents a unique social fabric with diverse cultures, ethnicities, and features rarely found elsewhere in the world.</p>

        <section class="independence">
            <h2>Independence</h2>
            <p>The Graduates' Congress was formed in 1938 as a social and cultural platform for graduates of higher schools in Sudan. However, it quickly called for the elimination of colonialism in Sudan and the right of Sudanese people to self-determination. The efforts continued until the Sudanese parliament convened on December 19, 1955, and declared Sudan's independence, requesting the Anglo-Egyptian condominium to recognize Sudan as an independent state. Independence was achieved, and the Sudanese flag was raised on January 1, 1956.</p>

            <h2>Climate</h2>
            <p>Sudan has a tropical climate characterized by high temperatures throughout most of the year, ranging from very dry in the north to semi-humid in the south. The climate is desert and semi-desert in the north (Northern State, North Kordofan, and North Darfur), and rainy in the central and southern regions. Most of the land is flat plains with elevations in the east, the Nubian Mountains, and Jebel Marra in the west. The annual rainfall ranges from nearly zero in the far north to 500-1000 mm in South Sudan. The Nile River and its tributaries play a vital role in Sudan's economic, social, and cultural life. The Nile waters are used to generate electricity, for navigation, and for fishing. The underground water reserves are estimated at about 900 billion cubic meters of water suitable for irrigation and civil uses.</p>
